### ðŸ“‘ Table of Contents
- [Retail & Commercial Banking](#banking)
    - Covers personal and business banking servicesâ€”checking and savings accounts, mortgages, SME financing, and credit solutions. Also addresses central banking operations, digital transformation in traditional banks, and AI-driven advisory for both retail and corporate clients.
- [Wealth Management & Capital Markets](#wealth)
    - Encompasses asset and wealth advisory, hedge funds, mutual funds, investment banking, and private equity. Includes securities trading, research, analytics, and AI-driven investment platforms for institutional and retail investors.
- [Payments & FinTech](#payments)
    - Focuses on digital payments, card networks, cross-border transactions, BNPL, embedded finance, and blockchain solutions. Also highlights AI-based fraud detection, risk assessment, and automated payment infrastructure innovations.
- [Insurance & Risk Management](#insurance)
    - Addresses life, health, property, and casualty insurance, along with reinsurance, underwriting automation, and actuarial modeling. Features AI-driven claims processing, fraud detection, personalized policy recommendations, and broader risk assessment tools.

Each example can be classified into one of 3 categories based on type of use case:
- **Enterprise-Wide**: Large-scale LLM deployments spanning multiple lines of business or the entire organization. These implementations typically address a broad range of tasksâ€”such as customer support, internal operations, and complianceâ€”within a unified, centrally managed framework.
- **Specialized Model**: Models either pre-trained or fine-tuned on focused datasets (e.g., regulatory filings, financial news) to achieve deep domain expertise. By narrowing the training data to specific tasks and terminology, they deliver higher accuracy and more relevant insights than general-purpose models.
- **Plug-and-Play**: Quick-to-deploy LLM solutions that handle specific use cases with minimal setup. Financial institutions leverage prompt engineering and ready-made integrations to streamline tasksâ€”such as AI-powered chatbots or document processingâ€”without extensive internal development.

<h2 align="center"><strong>Comprehensive Compilation of LLMs for Financial Services</strong></h2>


## ðŸ“Œ Context  
Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language processing, demonstrating exceptional capabilities across diverse applicationsâ€”from financial analysis to risk assessment and automated reporting.

As financial institutions recognize the value of LLMs, there is a growing trend toward customizing models for financial services, ensuring they capture sector-specific expertise, regulations, and terminology.

This repository serves as a centralized collection of finance-focused LLMs, documenting how companies and research groups develop specialized models tailored for banking, asset management, trading, risk analysis, and regulatory compliance.

By bridging the gap between LLMs and financial applications, this collection showcases real-world implementations, helping track advancements and trends in AI-driven financial services.

If you know of an finance industry-specific LLM that should be added to this repository, feel free to submit a **pull request** or open an **issue**!
